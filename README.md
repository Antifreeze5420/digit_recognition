This is a convolutional neural network trained with an 80/20 split on the MNIST database. The code used to train the model is in NumberRecog. The model is number_cnn1.keras, and if you want to run inferences on your own images, the notebook ImageDetector is available.
The preprocessing stage requires reshaping to 28x28, greyscale conversion, normalization, and scaling the image so the background is white. Sample images that I used for testing are also attached. I achieved 99.2% accuracy, and the better handwriting the better the model.
My plan for this model is to further integrate with edge detection software such that math equations can be recognized and formatted into latex, and then used in a wolfram alpha plugin.
